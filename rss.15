<h2 id="notes">Notes:</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>July flew by, October is looking like a realistic time to have the event now
*Would like to have photographers have their shots done by end of august/first week of september</p></li>
<li><p>Would like to see some shots during August as their taken just so the team has an idea how things are progressing and can plan accordingly</p></li>
<li><p>Tanya and Arti have been discussing how they want to go about written work, most likely they'll go through photographs with the photographers and talk about what the subject/place/thing as well as what went behind the photograph...another example that came up is Sean's environment shoot of an abandoned school, Tanya mentioned even contacting people who went to the school and asking a few questions</p></li>
<li><p>Less writing near photographs at show, more in newspaper and even having it's own place at show</p></li>
<li><p>Tanya mentioned possible having some sort of main piece which is a collaboration between the 3 photographers to link you guys together somehow</p></li>
<li><p>Venue -We have the spreadsheet @deevanie  and @artipanday  put together in case, but also had this discussion with a few of you already, but we're interested in moving to another space that doesn't necessarily have to be a gallery (ie. closed down retail space, can call the landlord for a one night pop-up event)</p></li>
<li><p>Charity wise, we're looking more at creating the collective pot now for future events and projects which are made for giving back, everyone at this meeting is very interested in creating workshops in which we teach the public different skills (will give more details on this soon)</p></li>
<li><p>August is about putting in the work now - photos, videos, work on sponsorship package (i'll need to work with someone regarding figuring out demographics/stats/costs)</p></li>
<li><p>Coming meetings: @deevanie @artipanday @ovitacole we'll work on a social media plan, as well as begin promo material with everyone, @anilh @soteeoh @seango are already going on photos so they'll continue figuring out their style, we'll need a team picture/headshots for sponsorship package ( @hoyitsandrew I'll get your help on graphics for this)</p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<ul>
<li><p>@hoyitsandrew, @tanya covered the drink by bringing by a bottle of Jack as a gift lol (thanks again!)</p></li>
<li><p>Movie Recommendations: 
@tanya recommends watching the documentary about The Koch Brothers
@soteeoh recommends watching: Boyhood - a movie which was filmed over the span of 12 years, creating a story about a child growing up</p></li>
</ul>]]></description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/week-5/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">7d40e71a-4414-4220-8e81-9ffe6b99088c</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Stiir]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2014 02:32:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Theme Clarification]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><img src='http://my-ghost-blog.com/content/images/2014/Jul/sgo_curves-1.jpg'  alt="sgo_eiffel" /></p>

<p><em>Photo: Sean Go</em></p>

<p>Had a conversation with Celeste regarding the theme, she asked some questions that would help to clarify our theme and work towards the long term vision.  Just in case there is any confusion, here are our thoughts which we hope will help. (excuse the bad grammar over email)</p>

<p>It's a longer read so here's some key points at the top, and if you want to read the whole convo below, you can check it out:</p>

<h4> Key Points: </h4>

<ul>
<li>Wisdom and Ambition is meant to be about the stories regarding the subjects.</li>
<li>It isn't focusing on a specific issue at hand, but is meant to inspire our audience to care about issues/lessons within the stories.</li>
<li>Our main goal is to inspire -- spark an interest in people.</li>
<li>This event is important in presenting the way our brand is portrayed. Understanding who we are and what are vision is about.
<ul><li>This will lead to future events/projects where we can get into more specific issues.</li></ul></li>
<li>How we present it is a major factor in how it will be interpreted.</li>
<li>Wisdom and Ambition shaping the future of the city is just one factor out of the many.</li>
<li><p>We're trying to understand if our vision can align with a charity right now or if we should use the funds raised towards a collective pot where we can give back in ways that we understand, being that our team as a whole has a variety of talents.</p>

<ul><li>Think about things such as workshops we can run and help motivate and teach people specific skills.</li></ul></li>
<li><p>We want to create a conversation.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Before I start trying to answer these, one of the things I realized is that for us to make any impact and be taken seriously, people need to understand who we are as a brand.  From a cultural standpoint we're always looking to inspire others to see their potential, and from our work we want to be known as a group that puts out what we consider to be a higher quality standard by using the resources we have.</p>
  
  <p>I know your trying to find something with more of a specific meaning in this, but the first gallery event is meant to be a little more vague because we are letting people know who we are and what we are about. It'd be good to even show people what our long term vision is.  For future events, we can always get more into specific issues and get deep into stats and steps needed. We can still touch on specifics a bit in this one, but this one is meant to be more of a launch, and still take a look at individuals in the city who have something to inspire others with; their story.</p>
  
  <p>We're using wisdom and ambition as a guideline that will allow the stories to come to us.  These stories we're hoping will help spark an inspired feeling within our audience.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2 id="qa">Q/A:</h2>

<h4> Photographs on display portraying wisdom and ambition |  
Wisdom and Ambition definition? </h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wisdom: "the quality of having experience, knowledge, and good judgment; the quality of being wise."</p>
  
  <p>Ambition:  "a strong desire to do or to achieve something, typically requiring determination and hard work."</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Who are we photographing that are wise and ambitious?</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>We'll be out looking for people that we feel have stories from experience and knowledge to share.  For the ambitious we'll be looking for people that have a strong drive to achieve a goal, this can be anyone from a young person looking to become/do something or an older individual driven to achieve a goal that they still fight for.</p>
  
  <p>The wise are connected to the ambitious, its the stories and the knowledge that help the ambitious realize what to expect in their path to reach their goal.  It's people who are ambitious that will help shape the way society moves forward.  Photographs may also not just be portraits on people, there may be stories behind things/environments that provide wisdom or even give a drive for people to make changes and make things 'better.'</p>
  
  <p>Who are these people/places/things going to be exactly? I can't say.  That's up to the photographers to find and see what speaks to them.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4> Does that tie into being successful- what is the measure of success - monetary ? emotional ? business owners? charities shelters? how are youth in envloved </h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>There's a variety to the measures of success to our subjects. Everyone will have a different form of success (or even failure in some cases, where a lesson was learned).</p>
</blockquote>

<h4> Main idea is that wisdom and ambition shape the future of Toronto - i'm not sure if i agree with that </h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>There's a lot of factors that shape the future of Toronto. You might have a different take on important factors that shape the city. We know there are specific steps that need to be taken for specific issues, however this is just taking a look from a characteristic perspective.</p>
  
  <p>Wisdom and ambition in my eyes dictate a lot of what will happen.  Like I said earlier, the wise help the ambitious.  We learn from successes and mistakes of others to help make change. When your ambitious you can even experience things like tunnel vision where you end up running into your own challenges and have to learn lessons on your own, this makes you wise for your future.  Our gallery will show the contrast of wisdom and ambition but also speak on the fact that we all have both inside us.</p>
  
  <p>I see that in the city as a whole, we're constantly learning and changing our methods. There are plenty of issues within our city that need to be addressed and so we need the people with the knowledge, mentorship, experience, and judgement to help the ones that will listen, learn, adapt, and have a drive to make changes.  </p>
  
  <p>I can't tell you the exact steps we need to take to end specific issues but we can at least inspire others in our city that need that push to take those steps.</p>
  
  <p>We're looking to get the discussions going.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4> if we are targeting people to to be motivated to start side projects/business affairs to do what? money/make a difference/make a change? </h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>We're looking to get people to realize the potential they possess. I believe people care about certain issues, and also believe they want to make a difference.  Our job is to give them the push they need to go out and understand the changes that need to be made, but mainly to understand that they have the potential to make differences. We can spark an interest in someone to want to give back, there could be one photograph or article that speaks to a person in the audience and makes a difference in how they live their life moving forward. </p>
  
  <p>However they need to make a difference or be motivated, whether it's starting a side project/business or putting money towards causes, that's up to them to learn about and decide.  Maybe they'll learn to go research something they saw in one of the stories we displayed, we're here to help provide the spark.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4> who is our target audience to show, to sell ,to inspire? our age group? younger older?  
is it dependent upon measure of success? </h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our audience can be many different age groups, however we'll be able to hit harder with a younger crowd because that's who we know we're able to bring out.  An older audience may be smaller but they may also connect or even be able to share stories of their own.  There are plenty of older people I still talk to who want to live for something more beyond their 9-5.</p>
  
  <p>The main goal is always to find a way to inspire. This gallery will help us understand our audience too.  Any information we can get from them to improve our events and understanding things they want to learn more about will help us improve.  The information can help us not only improve events but even move towards creating workshops where we can teach people skills that our own team possesses. (Could we talk as a team about workshops on our own and then at the event get people to sign up for more information in workshops they'd be interested in?)</p>
  
  <p>In terms of a monetary goal, I don't have a number in mind yet, this is what I need the team's help with. Money could be raised in various ways, through donations at the door, an online store, selling some form of merchandise, selling services, etc. I don't know exactly what we'll do yet, but that's a discussion that needs to be had with everyone.</p>
  
  <p>In terms of where money raised can go. Will it make sense to go to a charity if we can't find one that aligns with this event? Should it go towards a Stiir collective pot and be used to fund future events, workshops, etc. that Stiir puts on as our own form of giving back?   Just some stuff to think about first and discuss.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>  
Should we tie into how government can not produce a sustainable amount of jobs and its up to the private sector? what social issues are we targeting? unemployment? single mothers? families below poverty line?</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Private sector question is something to think about.</p>
  
  <p>These are things we could also incorporate in the paper. It depends on the subjects we photograph. This specific event is a little bit more general but we could do things like have some stats/infographics based on what the subjects stories are.</p>
  
  <p>We can plant seeds for future events where we get into more specific issues. These are all topics that I have interest in learning about and would like to touch on eventually.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4> I understand we mainly want to inspire people to do things outside of their 9-5 (some people are satisfied -waiting to retire to start their next chapter in their books)  have we considered all the external factors of peoples lives? </h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>External factors in peoples lives are an important aspect to understand. It's something we'll keep learning about in understanding the best ways to inspire people.  People who are satisfied may still have an urge to work on issues or even helping to inspire others with their own wisdom, and then there are people who may be satisfied and won't feel the need to give back, that's the reality of society, but if there's a way we can still spark something in as many as we can, we're doing our job.  We have to learn about these factors, this will evolve over time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4> Maybe we focus on one main accomplishment of those being photographed and interviewed and this discuss more their personal endeavours/ issues they faced/ stress levels how they dealt and persevered  
maybe some people were just really blessed  
a more personable approach  
what are the journalists asking?</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is exactly the kind of stuff I want us to look at. I hope as a team we can get these out of our subjects, the raw feelings and stories.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4> Based on our content we can decide what charity is appropriate - whether it be a moving forward/basic necessities/technology based etc own potential </h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is where it gets tricky. This is a big thing I want to talk about before we start approaching sponsors.  I feel that we can give back a lot ourselves with the money raised, I may be leaning more so in that direction as of now.  That's a team discussion to have.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4> * A lot of confusion growing up, but all realizing that we're more then just one role, it's a collective game </h4>]]></description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/theme-clarification/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">ad7e9e91-9a57-44c2-b2d4-aedf3956ca83</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Stiir]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2014 22:12:02 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Week 3]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><img src='http://my-ghost-blog.com/content/images/2014/Jul/gallery-1-1.jpg'  alt="week3" /></p>
